Just keeping track of attempts of myself and Shag trying to complete DKC2 without losing a life, in a single run.  
Because data and because we want to remember how well we did (also who ends the most runs...)  
   
Vanilla web dev structure. Hosted on my [github pages](https://mctipper.github.io/lossless-dkc2) because easy.

For local dev just open live server on port and then simply navigate to said port on localhost
